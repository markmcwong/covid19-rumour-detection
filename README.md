# covid19-rumour-detection

In this project, we propose our solution for Constraint@AAAI2021 - COVID19 Fake News Detection in English challenge, where we rank in the 3rd position with F1 score of 0.9860 on the test set against a top score of 0.9869. In our method, we first propose a baseline LSTM model, and then an ensemble model 1 consisting of different pre-trained language models such as BERT, RoBERTa, etc. We also apply various training strategies such as domain training, learning rate warm up and cosine decay.
